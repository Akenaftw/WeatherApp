# WeatherApp
Creating a weatherapp with html, css and vanilla js. 

DISCLAIMER: THIS FORECAST WONT WORK WITHOUT UPLOADING YOUR OWN API KEY INTO THE CODE!!

Had a lot of fun with this excercise. Played around with OOP for the second time and learned a lot by using this method. I love the structure it brings to my js files. 

I am still struggling a bit with the fetches but it is going beter and beter. My only fear is that if the fetch protocol deviates a bit of what I have done the past 2 times, I will waste a lot of time trying to figure out/understand how it fully works.

Also was nice to use css again after a couple of weeks of intensly focussed js course. Noticed that I was a bit rusty when it came to styling my sheet but found the fluidity back in the process of figuring out what I wanted to do.

Still have some flaws in the application, for example the api I am currently using gives 3 hour updates instead of daily weather updates. So I need to add another api and use the long and lat coordinates from the already fetched API to input into the url of the second one. Haven't done this yet before presenting because I don't want to brick my code before presenting.
